# The-Dark-Side-of-Goo
Slime platformer created with a friend.

Pretty old project, I've only created sprites and graphics here, credit for the code goes to "pitpo".
Hard, playable but buggy. You can grab items by pressing "e", and throw them at enemies with "space", when bar with skulls on top of the screen becomes red press "q" to become invincible and to gain the ability to eat enemies with "e" button.
